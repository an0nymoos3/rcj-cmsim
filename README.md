# RCJ-CMSIM
RoboCupJunior Competition Management System Improved (CMSIM) 


## Purpose
To replace the existing solutions written in JS that have grown to an unreasonable size and create an easier
solution to deploy and maintain.


## How to run
We plan to upload the docker image eventually, but for now you will have to clone this repo.  
Once cloned, navigate to `docker/` simply run 
```
docker compose up -d
```

## Contributing
Anyone is welcome to contribute. We don't have any strict guidelines for contributing yet, they might come later.
